# spring-demo-all-configuration-types
Here I practiced all methods of Spring configurations. How bean can be created using XML or Java Annotations. Also how they can be sanned. Also java only configurations. Scopes. Lifecycles. Injecting field values from properties files.

In Order to run one should have spring jars in his classpath added as vell as javax.annotation-api-1.3.2.jar for @PostContruct and @PreDestory annotations (for java 9+).
